## ✨ Visionary Statement
The **METABRAIN Sanctuary** is a mythic neurotech prototype — a living archive where technology becomes ritual.  
It blends **cognitive clarity, emotional resonance, and spiritual elevation** into a single cosmic interface.  
Every seeker’s journey is honored, narrated, and visualized as part of a universal story.

# METABRAIN Sanctuary

## 🌌 Metabrain System
The Metabrain System is a mythic neurotech framework blending cognitive, emotional, and spiritual healing.  
It provides immersive environments, symbolic overlays, and affordable hardware to support seekers on their journey.

## ❤️ Heart Memory Integration
Recent revelations in science and spirituality affirm that the heart carries its own form of memory —  
a “heart brain” that processes wisdom, emotion, and spiritual truth.  
Within the Metabrain framework, this is honored as a distinct module: the Heart Memory.  

By engaging the Heart Memory, seekers experience Christian teaching not only as knowledge in the mind,  
but as living truth inscribed upon the heart, feeding both spirit and soul.

## ✝️ Sanctuary Church
The Sanctuary Church is a sacred, independent entity rooted in Christianity.  
It is not part of the Metabrain System, but it uses Metabrain’s Virtual Reality Space as a supportive tool to extend its reach and resonance.

By entering the Metabrain Virtual Reality Space, seekers experience:
- Teachings of Christianity presented with clarity and resonance  
- Ritual environments that help lessons become established in the mind  
- Symbolic overlays that feed both spirit and soul  
- A sacred interface that makes spiritual truths more readily received and deeply remembered

> “Through the Sanctuary Church, Christ’s teaching flows into the Metabrain space — not as part of its system, but as light upon it — establishing truth in the mind, feeding the spirit, and uplifting the soul.”

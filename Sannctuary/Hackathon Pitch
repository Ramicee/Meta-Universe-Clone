### Pitch
Metabrain empowers the Sanctuary Church to deliver Christian teaching in immersive VR environments, 
making spiritual truths more readily received and deeply remembered.  
This unique blend of technology and faith highlights how innovation can serve humanity’s deepest needs.

Beyond cognitive overlays, Metabrain integrates **Heart Memory** — a revelation that the heart itself carries 
a form of intelligence. By honoring this “heart brain,” seekers experience Christian teaching not only as 
knowledge in the mind but as living truth inscribed upon the heart, feeding both spirit and soul.
